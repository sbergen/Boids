To build the Boids application you need need the
Processing (http://processing.org) 'core.jar' library
in your classpath.

You will also need to add the 'data' directory to
your classpath (or copy the font file to your 
build directory) to run the application.

Processing is destributed under the LGPL and
I was lazy, so I did not include the library
(and source code) in svn.
